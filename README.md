# Shooting Game

This is a rocket shooting game developed in Golang using the "https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/tree/master/sdl" library. It is my first project.
In the game you need to control the rocket using the left and right button and space button to shoot. Using these three buttons you have to destroy the blocks placed above the rocket.
